## Underbar

* Implement a `reduceRight` function
  * Do not use any external function calls (even to helpers) within your implementation.
  * `reduceRight` behaves much the same as `_.reduce`, but traverses the target in the opposite direction.
  * Note: your function only needs to work correctly on arrays.
