## Pull Request 
Copy and paste the Grading Outline above into the comment block of your [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Then, assign a grade to each item based on this [Grading Scale](https://github.com/hackreactor/curriculum/wiki/Grading-Scale). Lastly, before sending your Pull Request, change the base branch to be your username. Specifically, the Pull Request should read:

> hackreactor:username ... username:master


## Algorithm Complexity
* [ ] List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic complexity. Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
* [ ] What time complexity do the given functions have (with respect to the size of the input `array`)?



## Algorithms
* [ ] Write a function that, given a string, returns an array of all duplicated letters.
* [ ] Include a comment near the end of the file stating what complexity you believe your solution to be.


## D3
* [ ] Add a comment for each line in `d3_sample.js`. If you run up against a method call you haven't seen before, feel free to look up what it does -- but explain it in your own words.



## HTML/jQuery
The included index.html contains two paragraph tags, each containing a block of lorem ipsum text.
* [ ] Given the `<script>` tag at the bottom of the body and write a function that wraps every word in its own `<span>` tag.
* [ ] Make each word change color once per second to a random color.



## Inheritance Patterns
* [ ] The included class `SmartPhone` and its parent class `Phone` are written in the functional instantiation style. Refactor them to be written in the pseudo-classical style (using the keyword `new`), including shared methods.
