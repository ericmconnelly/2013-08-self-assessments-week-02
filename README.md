## Algorithm Complexity
* [ ] List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic complexity. Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
* [ ] What time complexity do the given functions have (with respect to the size of the input `array`)?



## Algorithms
* [ ] Write a function that, given a string, returns the first duplicated letter.
  * Extra credit: Return an array of all duplicated letters.
* [ ] Include a comment near the end of the file stating what complexity you believe your solution to be.


## D3
* [ ] Add a comment for each line in `d3_sample.js`. If you run up against a method call you haven't seen before, feel free to look up what it does -- but explain it in your own words.



## HTML/jQuery
The included index.html contains two paragraph tags, each containing a block of lorem ipsum text.
* [ ] Given the `<script>` tag at the bottom of the body and write a function that wraps every word in its own `<span>` tag.
* [ ] Make each word change color once per second to a random color.



## Inheritance Patterns
* [ ] The included class `SmartPhone` and its parent class `Phone` are written in the functional instantiation style. Refactor them to be written in the pseudo-classical style (using the keyword `new`), including shared methods.
