## Queue
* [ ] Implement a queue class.
  * You can use an array for storage, and delegate to its methods
  * The stack should only have `.add` and `.remove`, no other properties or methods (you can test this by calling Object.keys() on your stack instance)
  * The queue should clean up references to values that it no longer needs.
